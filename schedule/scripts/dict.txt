The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.

This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.\r\n\r\nNOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use \r\nthis course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer \r\nScience course.', '10.0', '12:00PM', '01:20PM', '(21127 or 15151) and (15112)', 'TR'], '17603': ['TEAM SOFTWR PROCESS', 11.75, 2, 5.0, {'ROSSO-LLOPART': (5.0, 2)}, '17602', '6.0', '', '', 'This course provides the student with an overview of a process that enables a team of software engineers to better work together.
