{% block content %}
 As you walk into the Chamber of Secrets, you notice a something moving around on the floor.  To your surprise, it's an oddly cute baby basilisk!  As you walk up to it, it hisses not-quite-viciously at you, and you notice it playing with a much larger basilisk's fang.  Klausledore had mentioned something about Harry carelessly leaving basilisk fangs lying around, and you're sure that such a fantastic magical artifact must have been chosen for one of Voldemath's horcruxes.  Foolishly, you forget that basilisks are extraordinarily dangerous at any age, and you lunge to catch it, getting bitten by the baby basilisk.  Fortunately, baby basilisk venom is not quite so potent as normal basilisk venom, and so you have a while left before you need an emergency infusion of baby phoenix tears.  You notice that the baby basilisk has swallowed the fang, and is rapidly retreating into the sewers, so you quickly pull out your wand and cast a confundus charm on it before it escapes into a narrow pipe.  From your understanding of Hogwarts' plumbing systems, the pipe will consist of multiple chambers each connected by a narrow pipe.  The baby basilisk will continue in a straight line for as long as its in a connecting pipe, but at a chamber it'll randomly choose a direction to go in because it's so confused.  This basilisk baby is pretty quick, and so it covers each section of pipe in only a minute, but your confundus charm is so confusing that the baby basilisk only has a 15/251 chance of moving away from you at each chamber, and sometimes it'll get tired and take a short (one minute) nap.  This has a 15/359 chance.  While its in the pipe, you quickly prepare a convoluted trap to catch it when it comes out.  How many minutes do you expect to wait before you can scamper up to the infirmary? <br /> <br />

 Express your answer as a fully reduced, improper fraction.
