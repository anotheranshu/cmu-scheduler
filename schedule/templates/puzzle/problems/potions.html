 Inside the bundle handed down from Klausledore, to your great surprise you find what appears to be a miniature treasure chest. A kind note is tied to the outside to help your confusion.
    <br /><br />
    <div class="quote">
      After a long gruesome research on the greatest magical mathematician, I realized that there might be something hidden in Vault 251 in Gringotts. To follow the awesome tradition of breaking into the best-guarded wizarding bank, my former students confounded some goblins, defeated some dragons and finally landed this tiny chest. I am giving this to you in the hopes that you unravel the secret hidden behind this chest.
    </div>
    <br />
    Without any hesitation, you shout â€Cistem Aperioâ€, and the chest springs open. To your surprise, instead of any clues, you find 7 tiny potion bottles, each of a different shape: there is a Troll(T), a Centaur(C), a Hippogriff(H), a Dragon(D), a Pixie(P), an Elf(E) and Golden Snidget(G). Under the bottles is a scroll of parchment with a note:
    <br /><br />
    <div clas="quote">
      Dear Witch or Wizard,
      <br /><br />
      To go forward, you need some truth, a plan, and above all, a little luck.
      <br />
      In the bottles are Veritaserum(V), Polyjuice Potion(P), Aging Potion(A), Amortentia(L), Elixir of Life(E), Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent(R) and Felix Felicis(F).
      <br />
      1-7 oz are their weights, and no two bottles are the same.
      <br />
      Pumpkin juice(P), butter beer(B), chocolate frog(C), bubble juice(J) exploding lemonade(E), gillywater(W) and Gurdyroot(G) are their unique tastes.
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>The Golden Snidget contains 1 oz more liquid than the Polyjuice. </li>
        <li>Of the ones that taste like exploding lemonade and Gurdyroot, one is 2 oz and the other is shaped like a troll.</li>
        <li>The Dragon shaped bottle contains either Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent or tastes like lemonade.</li>
        <li>The aging potion has 2 oz more than the Felix Felicis.</li>
        <li>The Veritaserum doesnâ€™t taste like chocolate frog. Nor does the liquid in the Centaur shaped bottle taste like butter beer.</li>
        <li>No two of the polyjuice potion, the Pixie shaped bottle, the Centaur shaped bottle and the one that tastes like chocolate frog are the same.</li>
        <li>Of the one that tastes like gillywater and the one with 6oz, one is shaped like Hippogriff and the other is Amortentia.</li>
        <li>Of the ones that are 6 and 7 oz, one gives fake love and the other is shaped like Hippogriff.</li>
        <li>The luck you need doesnâ€™t taste like pumpkin juice.</li>
        <li>The Golden Snidget, though a big belly it has, has less liquid than the one that tastes like the lemonade.</li>
        <li>The Polyjuice potion has 3 oz more than the Felix Felicis.</li>
        <li>The Dragon bottle contains 2 oz less than the one that tastes like bubble juice.</li>
      </ul>
      <br /><br />
      Good Luck, as always :)

    Confused, you all turned to the most Hermione-like member on your team, who would of course greet you all with contempt.
    <br /><br />
    "Don't you get it? It's obvious! You need to drink the Felix Felicis to find
	the witch or wizard who can help us! And by the way we need to feed
	Voldemath Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent when we find him!!!"
    <br />
    All the rest of you, annoyed by her/his showing off, decide that you want to figure out exactly which bottle is which, and incidentally, help you proceed to destroy the horcrux.
    <br /><br />
    (The answer must take form of the following: order the bottles by their weight, and for each bottle, order its attributes by shape, actual content and taste.
    <br />
    Use the abbreviation in the parenthesis following each attribute. For example, a sample answer would be
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1TVP2CPB3HAC4DLJ5PEE6ERW7GFG
    <br />
    If you believe the 1oz bottle is troll shaped, is Veritaserum and tastes like pumpkin juice, and so on)
