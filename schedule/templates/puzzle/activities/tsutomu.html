You proudly declare your answer to Gambol Japes, and he gives a little clap of joy. "Solid work, yo! Name your price."
    <br /><br />
    "How about $0.00?"
    <br /><br />
    "Wonderful! It's yours."
    <br /><br />
    Saying goodbye to Gambol and Japes for now, you take a closer look at your newfound possession. There seems to be tiny text on the back of the Galumphing Banderwoozles board. It reads:
    <div class="quote">
      This board property of Voldemath. Created and maintained by Tsutomu Okano. 
    </div>
    Wow! It was a Horcrux! Googling the name, you can find Tsutomu from 7:00 to 9:00 from Friday onwards. He will be at the Gates 3 chairs, and he should be able to help destroy what he's created.
